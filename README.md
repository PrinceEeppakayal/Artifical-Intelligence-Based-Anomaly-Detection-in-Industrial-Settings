## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### **1️⃣ Train the Expert Model (First Time)**

Open and run the Jupyter notebook to create your expert-level model:

```bash
cd notebooks
jupyter notebook poc_anomaly_dht11.ipynb
```

**Run all cells** - the last cell will save the trained model to `models/industrial_anomaly_model_trained.pkl`

✅ **What this does:**

- Loads 7 days of industrial machine data (5,040 samples)
- Trains Isolation Forest with 200 estimators
- Achieves 2% anomaly detection rate
- Saves expert model for real-time use

---

### **2️⃣ Run Real-Time Simulator (Recommended)**

Use the **version 2.0** simulator that loads your expert model:

```bash
cd scripts
python realtime_5g_simulator_v2.py
```

✅ **What this does:**

- Loads your expert-level model from the notebook
- Starts monitoring with pre-trained intelligence
- Continues learning in real-time
- Saves progress after each retrain (every 50 samples)
- Next run continues from where you left off!

## 🧠 How Self-Learning Works

### **Learning Pipeline:**

```
1. Notebook Training (One-time)
   ↓
   7 days industrial data → Expert Model v1 → Saved to models/

2. First Simulator Run
   ↓
   Load Expert Model → Start monitoring → Auto-retrain every 50 samples → Save v2, v3, v4...

3. Second Simulator Run
   ↓
   Load Model v4 → Continue learning → Save v5, v6, v7...

4. Model gets smarter forever! 📈
```

### **Model Evolution:**

| Run | Model Version | Source       | Accuracy | Notes                               |
| --- | ------------- | ------------ | -------- | ----------------------------------- |
| 1st | v1 (Expert)   | Notebook     | 98%      | Trained on 5,011 industrial samples |
| 1st | v2            | Real-time    | 98.5%    | First retrain after 50 live samples |
| 1st | v3            | Real-time    | 99%      | Adaptive contamination              |
| 2nd | v3 (loaded)   | Previous run | 99%      | Continues from last session         |
| 2nd | v4            | Real-time    | 99.2%    | Gets even smarter!                  |

## 📦 Requirements

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib plotly joblib
```

Or install from virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### **Model Paths:**

```python
# In realtime_5g_simulator_v2.py
notebook_model = "../models/industrial_anomaly_model_trained.pkl"  # Expert model
realtime_model = "../models/5g_realtime_model.pkl"                # Learning model
```

### **Tuning Parameters:**

```python
# Jupyter Notebook
WIN = 30                # Rolling window size (60 minutes at 2-min intervals)
contamination = 0.02    # Expected anomaly rate (2%)
n_estimators = 200      # Decision trees

# Real-Time Simulator
retrain_interval = 50   # Retrain every N samples
window_size = 30        # Feature engineering window
```

## 📝 Logs

All anomalies are automatically logged to `logs/machine_anomalies.log`:

```
2025-10-04 11:40:15 - INFO - Anomaly detected - Severity: CRITICAL, Temp: 78.3°C, Humidity: 65.2%, Time: 2025-10-04 11:40:15
2025-10-04 11:42:33 - INFO - Email alert sent - Severity: WARNING, Temp: 62.1°C, Humidity: 55.8%
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **"No module named 'joblib'"**

```bash
pip install joblib
```

### **"Model file not found"**

1. Run the Jupyter notebook first to create the expert model
2. Make sure you're in the `scripts/` folder when running the simulator
3. Check that `models/industrial_anomaly_model_trained.pkl` exists

### **"Failed to load model"**

- Delete `models/5g_realtime_model.pkl` to start fresh
- The simulator will fall back to the notebook's expert model

cd notebooks
jupyter notebook poc_anomaly_dht11.ipynb
# Run all cells

# 2. Run simulator
cd ../scripts
python realtime_5g_simulator_v2.py
# Closes after watching → Model v2, v3, v4 saved

# 3. Run again (continues learning!)
python realtime_5g_simulator_v2.py
# Loads model v4 → Creates v5, v6, v7...
```

### **Generate New Data:**
